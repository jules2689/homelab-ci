# Repos to watch. No webhooks: we poll for new commits on the given branch(es).
repos:
  - owner: your-org
    repo: your-repo
    branch: main
    # command: "make test"   # optional: override .ci-lite.yml
  # Watch all branches for a repo (use branch: "*" or branches: all):
  # - owner: other-org
  #   repo: other-repo
  #   branch: "*"
  #   # or: branches: all

# How often to poll for new commits (seconds)
poll_interval: 60
